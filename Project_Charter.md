# Project Charter – Community Solar Garden

- Project Name: Community Solar Garden
- Sponsor: City Sustainability Office
- Project Manager: [Team Lead Name]
- Team: [Student Names]
- Date: [MM/DD/YYYY]

## Objective
Deliver a 500 kW community solar garden providing clean energy access to local households, within the approved scope, schedule, and budget.

## Scope
- Design, procure, and install solar arrays and inverters
- Interconnection, permits, and inspections
- Site prep, mounting, wiring, and commissioning
- Community enrollment and handoff to operations

### Out of Scope
- Ongoing operations and maintenance post-handover
- Grid upgrades beyond the point of interconnection

## Schedule
- Duration: 10 weeks total
- Baseline cadence: linear PV of $100,000 per week
- Instructor advances the simulation one week at a time

## Budget
- Budget at Completion (BAC): $1,000,000
- Funding source: City capital program

## Success Criteria
- CPI (Cost Performance Index) ≥ 1.00 and SPI (Schedule Performance Index) ≥ 1.00 at finish
- Delivery close to original scope (minimal scope creep)
- Clear, sponsor-ready status reporting

## Assumptions
- No major regulatory changes during the 10-week period
- Vendors and contractors available as needed
- Weather roughly seasonal, with uncertainty handled via event cards

## Constraints
- Fixed 10-week simulation
- Initial BAC of $1,000,000 (subject to scope change events)

## Change Control
- Scope, schedule, or budget changes require instructor announcement (event) and team acknowledgment on the tracking sheet

## Weekly Cadence (Game Flow)
1. Instructor announces week status (normal, random event, bonus event)
2. Team decides planned work attempt and spending (AC)
3. Instructor confirms actual work completed (EV) and actual costs (AC)
4. Team calculates CV, SV, CPI, SPI and updates forecast as needed

## EVM Reference
- PV (Planned Value): Budgeted value of planned work to be done by the week
- EV (Earned Value): Budgeted value of work actually completed by the week
- AC (Actual Cost): Actual money spent by the week
- CV = EV – AC | CPI = EV / AC
- SV = EV – PV | SPI = EV / PV

## Reporting
- Weekly status entries on tracking sheet
- Final 10-week presentation: results, insights, and sponsor-ready narrative
