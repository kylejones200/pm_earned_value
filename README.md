# Classroom Activity Kit: Project Management and Earned Value Management

This folder contains ready-to-print materials for a 10-week simulation of a community solar garden project. Print the Markdown files or import the CSVs into Sheets/Excel.

## Files
- `Project_Charter.md` – Charter for each team to print and fill.
- `Baseline_PV_Table.csv` – Linear PV baseline ($100k/week) for 10 weeks.
- `Tracking_Sheet.md` – Printable tracking table for manual entry.
- `Tracking_Sheet.csv` – Digital tracking sheet for Sheets/Excel.
- `Random_Event_Cards.md` – 30 cards; print and cut to use as event deck.
 
### Kogod-Branded Variants
- `Project_Charter_Kogod.md` – Charter with Kogod header/footer.
- `Tracking_Sheet_Kogod.md` – Printable tracking sheet with Kogod header/footer.
- `Random_Event_Cards_Kogod.md` – Event cards with Kogod header/footer.

## Quick Start (Instructor)
1. Divide class into teams (3–5 students each) and hand out the Charter and Tracking Sheet.
2. Review EVM metrics: CV, SV, CPI, SPI and how to compute them.
3. Each week:
   - Announce normal progress or draw a Random Event card.
   - Teams decide attempted work and planned spend.
   - You confirm actual EV and AC for the week.
   - Teams update the Tracking Sheet (preferably cumulative values for CPI/SPI).
4. After 10 weeks, teams present results and reflections.

## EVM Formulas (Cumulative)
- CV = EV – AC
- SV = EV – PV
- CPI = EV / AC
- SPI = EV / PV

Success target: CPI ≥ 1 and SPI ≥ 1 while delivering original scope or justified scope changes.

## Branding Instructions
- Place your logo at `assets/kogod_logo.png` (recommended height ~60px). The branded Markdown files reference this path.
- Some Markdown viewers ignore inline `style` on images. If the logo appears too large when printing, edit the image file to an appropriate height or adjust the `style` width/height in the header tag.
